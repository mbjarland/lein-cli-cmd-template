# lein-cli-cmd
lein-cli-cmd is a leiningen plugin for creating "cli command" projects.

# Goals 
Remove all the boiler plate work in creating command line executables in clojure. You should run one command to create a best-of-breed skeleton project and then be left with just implementing the actual logic and defining the command line params. 

This projet will be updated as we come up with new ways of optimizing this process. 

# Prerequisites
This project requires a thusfar unreleased version of the `lein-bin` project. Please install this manually by checking out: 

https://github.com/mbjarland/lein-bin

and executing: 

```
$> cd lein-bin
$> lein install 
```

hopefully my [pull request](https://github.com/Raynes/lein-bin/pull/29) to the lein-bin project will be accepted some time soon, we can get a new version on clojars and this step will no longer be required. 

# Installation 
Check out this project, then: 

```bash 
$> cd lein-cli-cmd
$> lein install
```


# Usage
Issue: 

```bash
# create the cli command project
$> lein new lein-cli-cmd my-cmd

# cd into the newly created project dir
$> cd my-cmd

# the below will generate and executable jar which does 
# not require java -jar
$> lein bin 
lein bin
